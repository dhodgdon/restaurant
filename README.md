# Overview

This is a basic restaurant program in C++ using OOP. The user can place an order, see their order, and total their bill.

I created this software to learn the C++ language and to practice OOP in C++. I chose to learn C++ to become a more well-rounded software engineer and to familiarize myself with one of the most-used programming languages in the world today.

# Future Work

- Change the logic to not allow the customer to see the order or pay if they haven't added anything to the order yet.
- Add a daily deal by creating a DiscountedItem class that inherits from the Item class and has a discounted price that depends on the computer's timestamp.
- Add a Table class and give the customer the option to either dine in or take their food to-go.
